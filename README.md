Created this code while understanding the MVC structure.
Flow ->  1. Directory Structure
         2. Express and server setup
         3. Small Git actons like- .gitignore , git init,add,commit
         4. Setting up routers and controllers (different folders not using simple app.get or app.post in server file)
         5. View Engine (EJS)
         6. Use of Partials and Layouts
         7. Creating combined and seperate static files for different views
         8. Connecting to MongoDB
         
NOTE:- Commiting the changes after every step check in commits of project.
